# THIS CONTROLLER INHERITS FROM ONE IN THE SHINYCMS ADMIN AREA!
# (to make it possible to embed Blazer into the ShinyCMS admin UI)

# Inheriting from or using this controller for any additional purpose
# is probably a bad idea, for security reasons and for separation of
# concerns. Inherit from MainController instead.

# Patches welcome.
