# ShinyCMS

[ShinyCMS](https://shinycms.org/) is an open-source content management system built in Ruby on Rails, with support for [themes](docs/Themes.md), [plugins](docs/Developer/Plugins.md), and cloud hosting.

It is designed for professional web developers to use as a platform when building content-managed websites for their clients. It provides a number of features 'out of the box', with an easy-to-use admin interface for your clients to use when updating their site. You can also write your own plugins to add custom functionality.

To build a basic site on top of ShinyCMS, you just need to know HTML and ERB well enough to make any custom page templates that your site needs, or to modify those provided (at least until more ready-made themes are available; themes are easy to make, and theme contributions are very welcome).

## Documentation

[docs.shinycms.org] is generated from the documentation included in [/docs](docs/index.md).


## Installation and configuration

Please start by reading the [installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md) (or [tl,dr](docs/tldr.md) for the very short version).

### Demo site

Theme templates and sample data for a [demo site](docs/demo-site.md) are provided, so you can try all of the CMS features without doing any data-entry work first. You can run the demo site on a free Heroku plan, using the free/hobby pricing level for all the required dynos and add-ons.

### System dependencies

You will need a webserver, a Postgres-compatible database server, and a Sidekiq-compatible caching service (e.g. Redis).

You will need a mail server if you intend to enable any of the features that send emails; user registrations, reply notifications, etc. Anything supported by ActionMailer should work.

All other supported [external services](docs/Services.md) are optional. If you add config details for them (in ENV / .env* files / Heroku config) then they will be used, otherwise either the related CMS features will be unavailable or they will have reduced functionality.

### Ruby and Rails versions

ShinyCMS requires Rails 6 (which in turn requires Ruby 2.5 or later), and generally uses the most recent stable release of both Ruby and Rails (currently Ruby 2.7.2 and Rails 6.0.3.4).

It has been tested on every release of Rails 6 so far, and with most versions of Ruby from 2.5.8 onwards ([view recent test results][test results] for ruby 2.5.8, 2.6.6, and 2.7.2).

[Test results]: https://travis-ci.com/github/denny/ShinyCMS-ruby/builds/190156596

There are currently no plans to add support for Rails 5 or older Ruby versions.
