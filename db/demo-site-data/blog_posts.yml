  body: "<p>I&#39;m never sure what to do about demo content for ShinyCMS. The Perl
    version ended up with a weird mixture of content about the CMS, extracts from
    a book with suitably friendly licensing, and word salad from the Futurama Lorem
    Ipsum generator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now here we are with the Ruby version, and apparently
    I haven&#39;t learned my lesson - so I&#39;m starting with content about the CMS
    again. Or in this case, meta-content.</p>\r\n"
