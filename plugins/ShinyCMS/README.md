# ShinyCMS plugin

This plugin contains some core features of [ShinyCMS](https://shinycms.org), as well as the hooks to allow use of ShinyCMS feature plugins, and various common functionality those plugins can share.


## Installation

**Please see the [Installation Guide](../../docs/INSTALL.md) for more detailed instructions, with links to examples.**

You need to include some ShinyCMS code snippets in the `Gemfile` and `config/routes.rb` of the Rails application that you want to add ShinyCMS to. Then, add any ShinyCMS feature plugins that you want to use to the SHINYCMS_PLUGINS ENV var and run `plugins/ShinyCMS/tools/bundle-install` from the root of your host application.

It's not necessary to include this core plugin in the SHINYCMS_PLUGINS list, but it won't cause a problem if you do.

### Database setup

To add the ShinyCMS tables to your application's database:
```bash
rails shinycms:install:migrations
rails db:migrate
rails shinycms:db:seed
```

Once the tables are in place, load supporting data for the CMS and the core features:
```bash
rails shinycms:db:seed
```
