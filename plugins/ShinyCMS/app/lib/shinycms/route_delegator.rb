# The ShinyCMS route delegator is a mildly complicated routing bodge which
# helps ShinyCMS embed non-ShinyCMS engines into the ShinyCMS admin area,
# even if they weren't designed with that sort of embedded usage in mind.
#
# The idea was copied from RailsEmailPreview, which has this feature built-in.
# (Which made REP much easier to integrate with ShinyCMS - thank you!)

module ShinyCMS
  # Rescue calls to 'missing' ShinyCMS route helpers coming from inside other engines

      if main_app_route_method?( method )

      end
