# Plugin mailers can inherit from here to get some CMS integration and common behaviours.
#
# Mailers that inherit from here will need to override the implementations of `check_feature_flags`
# and `check_ok_to_email`. The `enforce_feature_flags` method is provided to help with the first,
# and the `enforce_ok_to_email` (or `enforce_do_not_contact`) method to help with the second.
