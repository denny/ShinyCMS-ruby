# Main config for test suite - pulled into main_app by /spec/spec_helper
#
# Rails-specific test config lives in plugins/ShinyCMS/spec/rails_helper.rb
#
# The ShinyHostApp `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will
# cause this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it
#
# Given that it is always loaded, it's good practice to keep this file as
# light as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file will
# add to the boot time of the test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration

  # you care about by tagging them with `:focus` metadata. When nothing
  # is tagged with `:focus`, all examples get run. RSpec also provides
  # aliases for `it`, `describe`, and `context` that include `:focus`
  # metadata: `fit`, `fdescribe` and `fcontext`, respectively.
  # config.filter_run_when_matching :focus

  # Allows RSpec to persist some state between runs in order to support
