# ShinyCMS Documentation

## Credits

An incomplete list of people who have helped, directly or indirectly, with the
creation of this software.

* [Eliot Sykes](https://eliotsykes.com) (@esykes), for extensive advice on too many parts of the system to name, plus generally making me a better Ruby developer over the last few years. I cannot recommend him highly enough as a coach for new or new-to-Ruby developers.

* aj (@ajkln) of [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) for the [Halcyonic theme](https://html5up.net/halcyonic) that the demo site uses, and the [Coming Soon](https://html5up.net/eventually) theme that is also included. All the great design in both themes is entirely aj's work (any errors will doubtless be mine, introduced as I cut the original HTML up to make view templates).

* Maximo (@maxvlc) and Luigi (@007lva), for reporting issues with running the demo site.

* Michael Snook (@michaelsnook) and Ed Saperia (@edsaperia), for numerous contributions to the brainstorming around mailing lists and related features.

* List of English language acronyms adapted from https://github.com/thingista/acronyms_and_more

* Everybody who contributed code, thinking, bug reports, and feature requests to the original ShinyCMS.
