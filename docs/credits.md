# ShinyCMS Documentation

## Credits

An incomplete list of people who have helped, directly or indirectly, with the
creation of this software.

* [Eliot Sykes](https://eliotsykes.com) (@esykes), for extensive advice on too many parts of the system to   name, plus generally making me a better Ruby developer over the last few years. I cannot recommend him highly enough as a coach for new or new-to-Ruby developers.

* aj (@ajkln) of [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) for the [Halcyonic theme](https://html5up.net/halcyonic) that the demo site uses. Entirely aj's work, I just had to cut it up to stick it in the various template files, and fix a few CSS collisions of my own making. I'm hoping to make a few more ShinyCMS themes from HTML5 UP themes in future.

* Maximo (@maxvlc) and Luigi (@007lva), for reporting issues with running the demo site.

* Michael Snook (@michaelsnook) and Ed Saperia (@edsaperia), for numerous contributions to the brainstorming around mailing lists and related features.

* Everybody who contributed code, thinking, bug reports, and feature requests to the original ShinyCMS.
