# ShinyCMS Documentation

## Credits

An incomplete list of people who have helped, directly or indirectly, with the creation of this software:

* [Eliot Sykes](https://eliotsykes.com) (@esykes), for extensive advice on too many parts of the system to name, plus generally helping me to become a much better Ruby developer. I cannot recommend him highly enough as a coach for new (or new-to-Ruby) developers.

* aj (@ajkln) of [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net) for the [Halcyonic theme](https://html5up.net/halcyonic) that the demo site uses, and the [Coming Soon](https://html5up.net/eventually) theme that is also included. All the great design in both themes is entirely aj's work (any errors will doubtless be mine, introduced as I cut his original HTML up to make my view templates).

* Luigi (@007lva) for code quality improvements, as well as various helpful issue reports.

* Maximo (@maxvlc) for reporting early issues with running the demo site.

* Michael Snook (@michaelsnook) and Ed Saperia (@edsaperia), for numerous contributions to the brainstorming around mailing lists and related features.

* Paul Cochrane (@paultcochrane) for improvements to the documentation.

* Pierre-Jean Camillieri (@thingista), for maintaining a useful list of [English language acronyms](https://github.com/thingista/acronyms_and_more).

* Manuel Gon√ßalves (@MrBowmanXD) for starting to work his way through my minor bugs backlog and TODO list on GitHub, and closing a lot of them with some minimal help and guidance from me.

* Everybody who contributed code, thinking, bug reports, and feature requests to the original ShinyCMS.

Thank you all, very much :)

(If your name should be on this list but it isn't, please nudge me to add it!)
