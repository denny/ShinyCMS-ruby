# ShinyCMS Developer Documentation

## Project Goals

This rewrite of ShinyCMS started out as as an educational exercise, giving me an opportunity to build a Ruby on Rails application from scratch and largely by myself. It's also been nice to have time for proper testing (100% coverage!), regular refactoring, and all the other things I don't get to do enough of at work :)

The original, [Perl version of ShinyCMS](https://github.com/denny/ShinyCMS) was built to satisfy the varied requirements of a number of clients during 10 years of working as a freelance web developer, so it's not a small project. Even though I built the vast majority of it, I was still surprised at the length of the feature list when I tried to list it all out near the start of this project.

My intention is to re-implement all of those features in the Ruby version (with some improvements), as 'Phase 1' of this project - then move onto adding new features after that.

I am completely open to new features being written by other people; fork the code and go for it! I'd love to hear from you when you start, but it's not compulsory :)

If you want to get involved in implementation of one of the features that I'm already halfway through re-implementing, or one that's on the original feature list but not yet started in this version of the CMS, please have a quick chat with me first (and I'll probably say "Great, thanks!")

### Progress so far

See the [done](done.md) list for features from the original ShinyCMS that I have already implemented in this version - as well as a few new ones that snuck in along the way - with notes on improvements from the Perl version where applicable.

See the [in-progress](in-progress.md) list for features that I am currently working on (with notes on where I'm up to, and links to useful docs).

See the [TODO](TODO.md) list for features from the original ShinyCMS that I haven't started implementing in this version yet... as well as ideas for new features (that I'm trying to resist building until I've caught up with the Perl feature list), and notes about fixes and refactoring that I want to do on the code I've already written.
