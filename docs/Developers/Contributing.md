# ShinyCMS Developer Documentation

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to ShinyCMS ... let me start by saying "Thank you!" :)

Here are some things to read that you might find useful:

* [Project goals](ProjectGoals.md)

* Project progress:
    * [Done](done.md)
    * [In progress](in-progress.md)
    * [Still to do](TODO.md)

* Instructions for [creating a new plugin](Plugins.md) (and related useful info)

* Tools and tips for [working on mailers](Mailers.md) (features that send email)

* Tools and rules for [testing](Testing.md) (this project has 100% test coverage)


### Are you new to coding?

You might want to start by looking at the issues tagged '[good first issue](https://github.com/denny/ShinyCMS-ruby/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)'; they're the ones that I think are particularly unlikely to turn into a nasty complicated mess halfway through. :)

If you find something that you'd like to tackle, but you're not feeling entirely confident about it, please do get in touch with me. I'd love to help you if I can, whether that's by talking the problem through in more detail to make sure you feel like you understand it, or discussing possible solutions, or even pair-coding with you on the solution you (or we) decide to try - whatever you think is most likely to help you, both with the issue at hand, and more generally as a software developer.

When I first started contributing to open source projects, I received a lot of incredibly valuable help and advice from more experienced developers - I would welcome more chances to pay that forward.


## Code of Conduct

This project has a [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md), which is intended
to make using ShinyCMS, or contributing to it, a harassment-free experience for
everybody involved - regardless of who they are and what they do or don't know.

Please read and follow the code of conduct - thank you.
