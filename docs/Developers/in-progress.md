# ShinyCMS Developer Documentation

## In progress

Everything that was in this document has now been moved to the 'In Progress' column of the [ShinyCMS project board](https://github.com/denny/ShinyCMS-ruby/projects/1)


## Done / TODO

See the [done](done.md) list for features from the original ShinyCMS that I have already implemented in this version - as well as a few new ones that snuck in along the way - with notes on improvements from the Perl version where applicable.

See the multiple 'To-do' columns of the [ShinyCMS project board](https://github.com/denny/ShinyCMS-ruby/projects/1) for features from the original ShinyCMS that I haven't started implementing in this version yet, and ideas for new features too (theoretically to be built _after_ the first list, but... things happen) ;)

There are also still to-do items in the old [TODO](TODO.md) document, which are slowly being transferred to the board as I get a chance.
