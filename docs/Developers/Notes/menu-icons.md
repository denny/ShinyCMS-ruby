# ShinyCMS: admin-area menu icons

All of the icons I've used in the admin-area sidebar menu (and a few other
places in the admin area) are part of the free icon set from CoreUI. If you're
adding a new feature (or want to change the icon for an existing one) you can
look here to see what's available: https://coreui.io/icons/free
