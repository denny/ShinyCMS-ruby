# ShinyCMS: Roadmap

Roughly speaking, my initial goal is to replicate the feature-set of
[the original version of ShinyCMS](https://github.com/denny/ShinyCMS)
without too much fundamental redesign of how features work (although some
of them really need it and I just can't help myself) and without too many
sidetracks into writing new features.

I am completely open to new features being written by other people; fork the
code and go for it! I'd love to hear from you when you start, but it's not
compulsory :)

If you want to get involved in implementation of one of the features that I'm
already halfway through reimplementing, or one that's on the original feature
list but not yet started in this version of the CMS, please have a quick chat
with me first (and I'll probably say "Great, thanks!")

For more information, you can look at the [project progress docs](Progress.md).
