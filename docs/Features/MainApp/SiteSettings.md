# ShinyCMS Features

## Site Settings

Change most site settings from within the CMS admin area (e.g. 'allow anonymous comments')

Allows you to specify which settings can be overridden by users - e.g. site_theme


#### Plugin status

This feature would be second from last to be converted into a plugin - after [User Accounts](UserAccounts.md) but before [Feature Flags](FeatureFlags.md).
