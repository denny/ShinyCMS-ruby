# ShinyCMS Features

## Upvotes

(AKA 'likes', '+1', etc)

The upvote features are powered by [ActsAsVotable](https://github.com/ryanto/acts_as_votable#readme).

The gem also offers downvotes; ShinyCMS has separate settings to turn on just the upvote feature, or both upvotes and downvotes.

( TODO: should be a feature flag to turn on/off the whole voteable feature-set, and then a setting for 'allow_downvotes' )


#### Plugin status

This feature will probably be moved into a plugin at some point.
