## Web stats

Recording of web traffic stats is built-in, using [Ahoy](https://github.com/ankane/ahoy_email#readme) to gather the data.

By default these features are disabled for privacy reasons. You can enable them on the Site Settings page in the admin area.

There are also some additional settings to enable/disable some [GDPR/privacy-related features](https://github.com/ankane/ahoy#gdpr-compliance-1) offered by Ahoy.
