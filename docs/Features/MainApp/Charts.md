# ShinyCMS Features

## Charts and Dashboards

ShinyCMS has [Blazer](https://github.com/ankane/blazer#readme) built-in, so that you can build your own custom queries, charts, and dashboards.

### Demo content

Currently there is not a default or demo dashboard (but it is on the [TODO](../../Developers/TODO.md) list).


#### Plugin status

This feature is likely to be moved into a plugin at some point.
