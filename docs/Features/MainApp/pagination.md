# ShinyCMS Features

## Pagination

Pagination features in ShinyCMS are powered by [Pagy](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy#readme).

Pagination is used in the admin area by almost all ShinyCMS features. On the main site, pagination is built into the default templates for features provided by the ShinyBlog, ShinyNews, ShinyNewsletter, and ShinySearch plugins.

### More information

If you want to modify the pagers on your main site, check [the Pagy docs](https://ddnexus.github.io/pagy/) for details of the various options available to you - including [integrations](https://github.com/ddnexus/pagy#frontend-extras) with a number of popular front-end frameworks.
