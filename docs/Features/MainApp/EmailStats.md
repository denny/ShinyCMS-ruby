# ShinyCMS Features

## Email stats

Email open and click tracking is built-in, using [Ahoy::Email](https://github.com/ankane/ahoy_email#readme) to gather the data.

By default these features are disabled for privacy reasons. You can enable them on the Site Settings page in the admin area.

Even when click-tracking is enabled in the settings, clicks will not be tracked for emails whose links might contain 'sensitive' data - e.g. password reset emails - but you can track opens for these emails.


#### Plugin status

This feature is likely to be moved into a plugin at some point.
