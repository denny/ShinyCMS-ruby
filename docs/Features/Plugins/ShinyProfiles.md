# ShinyCMS Plugins

## ShinyProfiles

The ShinyProfiles plugin displays a profile page for each registered user of a ShinyCMS site.

This feature is primarily intended for use on sites that want to encourage interaction with and between their users (linking into features such as comments, forums, etc), to 'put faces to names'.

It can also be used to power an 'our people' section on a company website.


#### Work in progress!

This feature was originally part of the [user accounts](../MainApp/UserAccounts.md) feature in the main app, and separating them is still a work in progress. Currently the views and controllers are separate, but the models and database tables are not.
