# ShinyCMS Plugins

## ShinyNews

This plugin adds a news / press release section to a ShinyCMS site.

News posts have titles, body text, tags, an author, and a posted date. They can be hidden, and they can be future-dated / scheduled.

On the main site, you can view recent news posts (the default) or view all posts in a specified month or year, as well as viewing individual posts.


### Integration with other CMS features

News posts can have comment threads, provided by the [Comments](../MainApp/Comments.md) feature. You can choose to enable/disable these per-post, as well as setting the default for all new posts in your [site settings](../MainApp/SiteSettings.md).
