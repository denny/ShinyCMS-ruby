# ShinyCMS Plugins

## ShinyShop

This plugin adds some rudimentary shop/checkout features to a ShinyCMS site.


### Stripe

The meat of the payment-handling functionality is provided by integration with [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart?lang=ruby) using the [Stripe Ruby gem](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby).


#### Caution!

This is a new feature! It has not been used in production yet, and (when appropriately configured) it will deal with real money.

Approach it with all due caution.
