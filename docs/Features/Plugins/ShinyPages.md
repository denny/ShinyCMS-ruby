## ShinyPages

This plugin provides content-managed 'brochure' pages, with layout controlled by page templates.

Pages can be organised into sections or left at the top-level. Sections can also be organised into sections, to any depth. Menus are dynamically generated.

Layout and appearance of Pages is controlled by Page Templates. These can be provided by a theme or custom-built by a web developer/
