# ShinyCMS Plugins

## ShinyNewsletters

This plugin adds the ability to send promotional HTML emails.

It requires ShinyLists to be enabled too, to manage mailing lists and subscriptions.

* Build HTML mailshots based on MJML templates (provided by a theme or custom built for you)
* Simple admin interface to fill in the editable content areas in each edition

Support for scheduling sends is not working yet, but 'send now' does.
