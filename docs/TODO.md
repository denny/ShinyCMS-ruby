# TODO (longer-term)

Possible future features, that aren't in the Perl version of ShinyCMS,
or that are a major rebuild of an existing feature.

* Improve UX for slug auto-generation; use ideas (and code?) from Fae CMS:
  https://www.faecms.com/documentation/features-slugger

* Allow Page templates to be stored in database and edited in admin UI

* Switch from ERB to handlebars or similar for main site templates

* Allow in-situ editing of Page (and other?) content, using Mercury:
  https://jejacks0n.github.io/mercury/
